## Known Bugs

_{When adding contacts then trying to delete them there is a small issue when you only have one contact and you are trying to delete. When you have multiple contacts saved you can delete them one by one only when you delete from the bottom going upward. It said it was an searchId issue that the index is out of range. It is functional besides the order of deletion and sometimes single deletions. }_
